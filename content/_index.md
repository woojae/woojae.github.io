Hello! I’m Woojae Lee, a "DevOps" Engineer. My passion lies in building robust, scalable cloud platforms, with a specialization in Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure, particularly on AWS and GCP. Throughout my career, I’ve managed server infrastructures for high-traffic websites and engineered complex, multi-region Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, I bring a strong focus on observability, ensuring that systems are not only resilient but also transparent and easily monitored.
