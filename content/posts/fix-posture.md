During my time in Korea, one of my main goals is to work on improving my posture. I've struggled with poor posture for most of my life, which has led to an unattractive hunchback and constant back pain. Now that I have some time off, I'm determined to correct it.

I've done some research using ChatGPT and YouTube, and this is what I came up with.  Let's see if works.

My specific goals are to be able to do 10 pull-ups, 50 push-ups, and maintain a straight back.

### **Push Up Exercises**

### 3-Month Push-Up Training Plan

This plan is designed to gradually increase your push-up strength and endurance so that you can reach 50 consecutive push-ups in 3 months. The plan is divided into three phases, with each phase lasting about 4 weeks. You'll be working on push-ups 3 times a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday), allowing for rest days in between to recover and build strength.

#### **Phase 1: Building a Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

**Goal:** Increase your push-up capacity to 20 consecutive push-ups.

- **Day 1:**  
  - 3 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 50% of your maximum in each set (e.g., if you can do 10, aim for 5 reps per set).  
  - After completing the push-ups, do 3 sets of knee push-ups (10-15 reps per set) or incline push-ups to work on form and endurance.

- **Day 2:**  
  - 4 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 60% of your maximum in each set.  
  - Finish with a plank hold for 3 sets of 30 seconds.

- **Day 3:**  
  - Test day: Do as many push-ups as you can in one set.  
  - Follow up with 2 sets of push-ups at 50% of your maximum.  
  - Cool down with 3 sets of tricep dips (10-12 reps per set) to strengthen supporting muscles.

#### **Phase 2: Strengthening and Endurance (Weeks 5-8)**

**Goal:** Increase your push-up capacity to 35 consecutive push-ups.

- **Day 1:**  
  - 4 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 70% of your maximum in each set.  
  - After completing the push-ups, do 3 sets of decline push-ups (feet elevated) for 8-12 reps.

- **Day 2:**  
  - 5 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 75% of your maximum in each set.  
  - Finish with a plank hold for 3 sets of 45 seconds.

- **Day 3:**  
  - Test day: Do as many push-ups as you can in one set.  
  - Follow up with 3 sets of push-ups at 60% of your maximum.  
  - Cool down with 3 sets of shoulder taps (20 reps per set) to work on stability and core strength.

#### **Phase 3: Mastery and Reaching Your Goal (Weeks 9-12)**

**Goal:** Reach 50 consecutive push-ups.

- **Day 1:**  
  - 5 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 80% of your maximum in each set.  
  - After completing the push-ups, do 3 sets of diamond push-ups for 8-10 reps to build tricep strength.

- **Day 2:**  
  - 6 sets of push-ups with 60-90 seconds rest between sets.  
  - Aim for 85% of your maximum in each set.  
  - Finish with a plank hold for 3 sets of 60 seconds.

- **Day 3:**  
  - Test day: Do as many push-ups as you can in one set.  
  - Follow up with 3 sets of push-ups at 70% of your maximum.  
  - Cool down with 3 sets of pike push-ups (8-10 reps per set) to strengthen shoulders and upper chest.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rest and Recovery:** Ensure you get adequate sleep and nutrition to help your muscles recover and grow.
- **Form First:** Focus on maintaining proper form throughout the push-ups to avoid injury and maximize effectiveness.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep a log of your progress each week to stay motivated and on track.

By consistently following this plan, you should be able to reach your goal of performing 50 consecutive push-ups in 3 months.
