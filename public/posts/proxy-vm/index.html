The experience has been fascinating on many levels, though not without its frustrations. One unexpected frustration is the way some websites don&rsquo;t work here. Website owners block access to users from Asian countries. This is usually to filter out bots and scammers, as well as licensing rights that are geographically bounded. I was not able to log into starbucks.com to purchase a gift card because of this. Starbucks in Korea is partially owned by the Shinsegae corporation in Korea, so whenever I tried to log into starbucks.com it simply would not work.</p>
<p>Another thing I was not able to do was watch PBS in Korea. I’ve had an abnormal love of PBS since Jr. High.  I used to record episodes of Frontline, Nova, and American Masters on VHS tapes. I even donated money to PBS. But in Korea I can’t watch Nova or Frontline.</p>
<p>Since I’m a “devops” engineer I used my Devops wizardry to watch Frontline. The simpler solution would be to purchase a VPN service like (Nord, or Express), but that’s $10 dollars a month. That seems like alot of money to watch a single episode of Frontline, or buy a starbucks gift card. Instead I could temporarily spin up a proxy server on AWS and the cost to watch an episode of Nova will be less than 10 cents.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the terraform code to spin up a proxy server on AWS. This will output a public IP address that you can use to access the proxy server. After running this terraform, configure <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-settings-firefox">Firefox</a> to use the proxy server.</p>
<p><img src="https://woojae-images-1.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/firefox_proxy_settings.png" alt="Firefox setting"></p>
<p>Use the public IP address and port 8080 to access the proxy server.</p>
